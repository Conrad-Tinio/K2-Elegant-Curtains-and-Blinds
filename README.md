# K2 ELEGANT CURTAINS AND BLINDS 

## ABOUT US
K2 Elegant Curtains and Blinds is a family-owned business. "K2" was derived from the first letter of our children's names, Kurt and Kyle. Starting as a small reseller of ready-made curtains in 2020, the business has quickly expanded into a full-service provider of custom-made curtains and blinds for homes and businesses.

At K2 Elegant Curtains and Blinds, we believe that a beautifully designed window treatment can transform a house and make a lasting impression on our customers.
We have a wide variety of fabrics that our customers can choose from. We also offer a range of products such as motorized curtains and blinds, roller shades, wood blinds, accordion doors, panel boards, and bed linens.
